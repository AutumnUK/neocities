        Aiming
        <br>
        年2024 月09 日20

        Hello. Today I'm going to talk about a sudden obsession of mine. Aim training.
        I've played FPS games on and off, very casually, for as long as I can remember. Sicne the days of the
        sega saturn port of Quake to most recently picking up Valorant. This has led me to thinking about ways
        to optimise my improvement in FPS games so that I can focus on hitting my goals within the games quicker.
        <br><br>
        At first I was just interested in getting Valorant installed as something to do during my holiday. Perhaps
        I'd enjoy it right? Well I did, a lot. However it's quite a tiring game to farm matches in and I own kovaaks
        aim trainer so I thought I'd give that a go. But along the way I must have tripped because I ended up loading
        up AimLabs. Which for full transparency, I've used in the past for a couple of hours where I hit the rank of ruby.
        I don't know how good or bad that rank is, but that's where I go to. Now in pushing to 10 hours I've climed up to
        platinum with my goal of hitting Diamond getting startlingly close.
        <br><br>
        Now with this in mind I want to shift away from AimLabs and focus on things I want to do to optimise growth.
        The first will be getting a new monitor mount, my current monitor stand actually sits on my mousepad and blocks my 
        mouse which isn't good. The second thing will be to get a new mousepad. I'm not going to go super high end with this
        purchase. It'll just be a solid large mousepad, fit for FPS.
        <br><br>
        Then with the in-game strategy for getting diamond I will focus purely on tasks within the ranked playlist, where I 
        have to push a score up at least once a day (at least 1 task) and I should spend about 30 minutes in the aim trainer.
        That's it really.

        Day 2 of blogging, it's 23:38 right now and it's the second day of my holiday. So far I've just spent
        the whole time dealing with a chest infection. I'm also still addicted to valorant, I think I'll be able
        to play 100 games of swiftplay before the week is over. Other than my valorant addiction I don't have much
        to talk about. Hopefully I can build a little rasp pi zero file server which can store my anime/manga.
        <br><br>
        Oh also Yu-Gi-Oh's Singaporean dub is hilariously bad. I highly recommend checking it out. Hopefully tomorrow
        I will have more to talk about. I also need to stop writing my blog directly into the html of this site.
        <br><br>
        I think tomorrow I will finish watching Initial D, then I can properly talk about it and all of my favourite 
        cars featured in it.

        I haven't had a blog since (this is a guess), 2009? Blogging hasn't really been the 'in thing'
        online outside of blogs to generate money. At least I haven't been exposed to it. I definitely
        caught the social media bug since my last blogs. I blame bebo / facebook for that one.
        After all, nobody was using google+ for more than a week. Did you know there was briefly a video
        game themed social media platform in 2016?
        <br><br>
        Anyway today I'll just ramble a bit. Right now I'm still working on this site, which is pretty fun.
        I'm also on a 2 week break from work (16th September until 1st October). That's not actually 2 weeks
        but I get extra days on both ends due to my rota being fixed. A rarity for retail.
        <br><br>
        During this 2 week break I'm going to be focusing on a few projects. Since I've just finished my
        degree I'd like to spend time not worrying about finding a fancy job and instead just having fun.
        This will be making a series of doom maps (which will be posted in the projects page eventually).
        Building out this website and going to the gym frequently.
        <br><br>
        I'm not sure what else to add. Hopefully I can maintain activity here over the next few weeks!
        <br><br>
        Here is one of my cats as a kitten.
