        I've readjusted the website for 800/600 displays. (I'm using 1280/720 in one room, 
        1280/1024 in another, 1920/1080 everywhere else). I also added a template page and
        some basic javascript to load content onto each page. Eventually I'll have a content management system in place.

        Added the guestbook today! Hopefully it gets used. Eventually I'll host my own
        guestbook on a server in my office. (Future project btw.)

    First upload today. Really happy with how this is coming together.
    I'm not sure what the plan is with this project, but it'll be fun.
    I will use this page to highlight key technical changes here on the website.
