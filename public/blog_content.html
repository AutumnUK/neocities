        I haven't had a blog since (this is a guess), 2009? Blogging hasn't really been the 'in thing'
        online outside of blogs to generate money. At least I haven't been exposed to it. I definitely
        caught the social media bug since my last blogs. I blame bebo / facebook for that one.
        After all, nobody was using google+ for more than a week. Did you know there was briefly a video
        game themed social media platform in 2016?

        Anyway today I'll just ramble a bit. Right now I'm still working on this site, which is pretty fun.
        I'm also on a 2 week break from work (16th September until 1st October). That's not actually 2 weeks
        but I get extra days on both ends due to my rota being fixed. A rarity for retail.
        <br><br>
        During this 2 week break I'm going to be focusing on a few projects. Since I've just finished my
        degree I'd like to spend time not worrying about finding a fancy job and instead just having fun.
        This will be making a series of doom maps (which will be posted in the projects page eventually).
        Building out this website and going to the gym frequently.
        <br><br>
        I'm not sure what else to add. Hopefully I can maintain activity here over the next few weeks!

        GLHF!
